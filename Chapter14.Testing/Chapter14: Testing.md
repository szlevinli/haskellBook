## 14.1 Testing

## 14.2 A quick tour of testing for the uninitiated

Spec testing can be especially valuable if nonprogrammers need to be able to read and interpret the results of the tests -- they can read the English-language results of the tests and, in some cases, write tests themselves.

Property testing test the formal properties of programs without requiring formal proofs by allowing you to express a truth-valued, universally quantified (tha is, will apply to all cases) function -- usually equality -- which will then be checked against randomly generated inputs.

> 属性测试通过允许您表达真值, 普遍量化 (即适用于所有情况) 函数 -- 通常是相等的 -- 来测试程序的形式属性而不需要形式证明, 然后将根据随机生成的输入检查该函数.
